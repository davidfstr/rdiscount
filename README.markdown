USAGE
-----

RDiscount implements the basic protocol popularized by RedCloth and adopted
by BlueCloth:

    require 'rdiscount'
    markdown = RDiscount.new("Hello World!")
    puts markdown.to_html

Additional processing options can be turned on when creating the
RDiscount object:

    markdown = RDiscount.new("Hello World!", :MKD_NOHTML)

Inject RDiscount into your BlueCloth-using code by replacing your bluecloth
require statements with the following:

    begin
      require 'rdiscount'
      BlueCloth = RDiscount
    rescue LoadError
      require 'bluecloth'
    end
