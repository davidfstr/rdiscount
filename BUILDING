BUILDING rdiscount
==================

You'll be needing Ruby, rake, and a basic build environment.

Build the rdiscount extension for tests and local development:

    $ rake build

Use your rdiscount working copy when running ruby programs:

    $ export RUBYLIB=~/rdiscount/lib:$RUBYLIB
    $ ruby some-program.rb

Gathering changes from an upstream Orc/discount.git clone requires first
grabbing the discount submodule into the root of the project and then running
the rake gather task to copy discount source files into the ext/ directory:

    $ git submodule update --init
    Submodule 'discount' (git://github.com/rtomayko/discount.git) registered for path 'discount'
    Cloning into discount...
    $ cd discount
    $ ./configure.sh  # to generate mkdio.h from mkdio.h.in
    $ cd ..
    $ rake gather
    $ rake build

The rtomayko/discount.git repository's master branch is the default submodule
head. It exists to merge branches for rdiscount specific patches to the upstream
discount codebase.

Do work in the submodule and then add a remote for your clone THAT YOU FORKED ON
GITHUB BECAUSE YOU'RE GOING TO SEND ME A PULL REQUEST. After you've committed
your great changes somewhere, push them up with:

    $ cd discount
    $ git remote add you git@github.com:you/discount.git
    $ git push you HEAD:topic-branch-name
